## Status

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ole/SortedArray.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ole/SortedArray)

## Supported Platforms

The current release supports Swift 4.0 and up.

If you need support for older Swift version, here's a list of the latest releases that support specific Swift versions:

| Swift version | Latest SortedArray release |
| ------------- | -------------------------- |
| 4.x           | master                     |
| 3.x           | [0.6.0](https://github.com/ole/SortedArray/releases/tag/0.6.0) |
| 3.0           | [0.4](https://github.com/ole/SortedArray/releases/tag/0.4.0)   |

Since the code has no dependencies other than the Swift standard library (it doesn't even use Foundation), it should work on all platforms where Swift is available.

I tested it on macOS, iOS, tvOS, and Linux.

## Usage
